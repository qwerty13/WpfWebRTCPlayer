# Wpf WebRTC Player

A handy tool to play WebRTC live streams (like [OME](https://github.com/AirenSoft/OvenMediaEngine)) on Windows machines (specially on video-walls).
It's based on Webview2, embedded OvenPlayer, wpf GUI and C# using .NET 6.

the structure of project is simple so you can change it as you need.
